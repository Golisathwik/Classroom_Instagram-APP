## üéØ The Problem

Traditional classroom management tools (like Google Classroom) are formal, rigid, and non-engaging. Students rarely interact beyond submitting assignments, leading to low motivation. Meanwhile, students are highly active on social media platforms, which foster creativity, peer interaction, and instant updates.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

"Classroom Instagram" is an AI-powered academic social platform that works like Instagram for the classroom. It's visual, interactive, and engaging.

* Teachers can post academic notices, assignments, marks, and attendance.
* Students can interact with posts, submit work, and view their grades.
* A built-in AI assistant helps students study by generating flashcards from notes.

## üèÜ Key Features

### 1. Role-Based Dashboards (Student vs. Teacher)

The app provides a completely different, tailored UI depending on the user's role, which is selected at sign-up.

| **Student Dashboard** | **Teacher Dashboard** |

### 4. The Complete Academic Loop (End-to-End)

This is the core of the platform. We built the *entire* feedback loop for assignments.

#### 1. Teacher Posts Assignment
Teachers get a dedicated "Create Assignment" form with title, description, and a due date picker.

#### 4. Teacher Views Submissions
The teacher's dashboard lists all student submissions for each assignment. They can view the file and see the student's comments.
[**ADD SCREENSHOT of the `view_submissions_page.dart` showing the list of students who submitted**]

#### 5. Teacher Posts Grade
The teacher can post a mark (e.g., "A+" or "95/100") directly from the submissions page.
[**ADD SCREENSHOT of the "Post Mark" pop-up dialog**]
